            <h3> About Me </h3>
            <p>After graduating college, I became interested in coding and software development. While I continue to have interest in Biotechnology, I believe that having knowledge in software development can boost my career.</p>
            <p> One of my greatest hobbies is Volleyball and I am currently coaching at a local high school. It is a passion that has evolved as I enjoy teaching others how to play.</p>
            <p> I've started my journey to becoming a software developer with the resources <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> provides and am excited to see what I can learn. </p>
            <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer or interested in exchanging ideas please don't hesitate to reach out. I am eager to work with others to build amazing software.</p>
